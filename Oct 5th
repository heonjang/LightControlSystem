## Units of Light

When searching for LEDs to grow our plants, we quickly realized that there were different units of light intensity used to represent how bright the LEDs are.
In order to be able to convert units conveniently, we decided to first grasp a better understanding of the units of light intensity first, then proceed with
deciding which LEDs to use.

### Lumens (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit))

The lumen (symbol: lm) is the unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source per unit of time, 
in the International System of Units (SI). Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted,
while luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a "luminosity function") of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths. 
One lux is one lumen per square metre.

### Lux (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux)

The lux (symbol: lx) is the unit of illuminance, or luminous flux per unit area.

### Conversion

Since our prototype focuses on light intensity per one foot square, one lux = (1 lum / m^2) * (1 m^2 / 10.764 ft^2) = 0.09 lumen / ft^2
