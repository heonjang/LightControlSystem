## Design

### Cost Reduction
To bring down the costs of the grow light module, cheaper components are reselected as shown below: 

| LED      | Cost | Intensity | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- |
| [UV](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kingbright/AA3528VRVFS-A?qs=rY7msk5yxfb63mh907EyRA%3D%3D) (315-400 nm)     | $0.67      |  250mcd |  ----------- |
| [Blue](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/w%C3%BCrth-elektronik/150141BS73130/13584853) (440-500 nm) | $0.40 |  1000mcd (max) |  decently high mcd rating, to avoid burn out might opt for lower intensity |
| [Yellow-Red](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/vishay-semiconductor-opto-division/VLMO233U1AA-GS08/3025492) (610-700 nm)  | $0.51        |  760mcd |  ----------- |
| Green  (510-610 nm) | Text        |  ----------- |  ----------- |
| **Total**  | Text        |  ----------- |  ----------- |


### Addons to Design
To accomodate these LEDs, 5V will be provided to each module instead of 3.3V
