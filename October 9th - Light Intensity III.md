# Light Intensity III

The [Light Intensity II](https://github.com/heonjang/LightControlSystem/blob/Christelle/October%208th%20-%20Light%20Intensity%20II.md) entry, revealed a key shortcoming from our final design, not enough lumens were provided.

Following the light standard determined previously, our design has 3 objectives, to provide:
1. between 50 (538lm) and 250 foot-candles (2690 lm) for low light plants
2. 750+ (8,070 lm) foot-candles  for medium light plants
3. 1000+ (10,760) foot-candles for high light plants
