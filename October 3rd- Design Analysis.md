## Design Limitations and Considerations

One of the current limitations the prototype faces is price. Mainly, the number of grow light modules is limited by their cost. 

One module based on the circuit from the design document costs $6.37. The most costly components being the UV LED at 2.77, the relays at 1.26 and the 
Blue LED at 1.10.

As identified in the journal entry from [October 2nd](https://github.com/heonjang/LightControlSystem/blob/Christelle/10_2_2022.md), 1000+ foot-candles of light or 10,0000 lumens should be provided to accomodate High-light plants. 10,000 Lumens is a substantial amount of light.
Due to budget limitations, it is not feasible to expect to provide 10000 lumens reliably. As such our prototype will be specifically for low and medium light plants.
