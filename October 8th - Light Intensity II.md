# Light Intensity

Currently the fundamental design question needs to be answered: _How much light can and should be provided by our design?_

## Design Analysis
Referring to the final LED choice described in [the journal entry from October 7th](https://github.com/heonjang/LightControlSystem/blob/Christelle/October%207th%20-%20General.md), each grow light module will provide 2.72 cd.

A foot-candle is [defined as](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-foot-candle-definition/) "the amount of light that falls on a surface that is 1 foot away from a singular candle"
