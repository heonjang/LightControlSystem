# LightControlSystem

## Do I need to cite the Youtube video for Motorized Blinds Subsystems?
## Research on number of LEDs needed, not going to do high-light plants as we need too many LEDs.
## UVLEDs are very pricey, perhaps we don't incorporate them or find cheaper subsitutes
## Can we switch out relays with transistors, as no component uses 120V (we swapped out UVA Bulbs for LEDs, which take low voltage)
## Need to add total cost + human resource cost
## Perhaps ask if we need other tolerance anaylsis
