## Design

One of the current limitations the prototype faces is price. Mainly, the number of grow light modules is limited by their cost. 

One module based on the circuit from the design document costs $6.37. The most costly components being the UV LED at 2.77, the relays at 1.26 and the 
Blue LED at 1.10.
