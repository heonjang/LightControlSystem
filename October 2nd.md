## Design
The protoype will be designed to provide light for various types of plants: low, medium and high-light plants.

TO best accomodate as many types of plants as possible, the design should produce 1,000+ foot-candles of light.

| Type      | Lumens |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Low-light plants  | 50 and 250 foot-candles     |
| Medium-light plants   | 250 to 1,000 foot-candles (Best above 750 foot-candles)   |
| High-light plants   | 1,000 foot-candles mininmum|

As described in the design document, there will be a number of grow light modules. These grow ligt modules are sets of 4 different types of LEDs: blue, 
red, green, and UVA leds as a combination of these was determined to provide optimal wavelengths of light for plant growth.
