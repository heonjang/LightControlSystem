## Light Intensity Objectives
The protoype will be designed to provide light for various types of plants: low, medium and high-light plants.

To best accomodate as many types of plants as possible, the design should produce 1,000+ foot-candles of light.

| Type      | Lumens |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Low-light plants  | 50 and 250 foot-candles     |
| Medium-light plants   | 250 to 1,000 foot-candles (Best above 750 foot-candles)   |
| High-light plants   | 1,000 foot-candles mininmum|

As described in the design document, there will be a number of grow light modules. These grow light modules are sets of 4 different types of LEDs: blue, 
red, green, and UVA leds as a combination of these was determined to provide optimal wavelengths of light for plant growth.

Referring to the datasheets each of the LEDs will provide the following light intensity:

|LED | Intensity  | Viewing Angle | |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| UVA  |  40mcd| 30 degrees| |
| [Blue](https://www.we-online.com/catalog/datasheet/150141BS73140.pdf)| --- | 125 degrees|27 lm |
| Yellow-Red  | 100mcd| 130 degrees| |
| Green  | 500mcd | 120 degrees| |

* The UVA LED used is changed to [MT0380-UV-A](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/marktech-optoelectronics/MT0380-UV-A/4214613)
