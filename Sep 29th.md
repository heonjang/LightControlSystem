# Sep 29th Updates

## Added first draft of MOTOR schematic. Things to note:
### Need to understand JTAG, UART, debouncing stuff for switches
### HS-40012 is just a 120VAC to 12VDC power supply (https://www.amazon.com/TMEZON-Power-Adapter-Supply-2-1mm/dp/B00Q2E5IXW/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=12v+dc+power+supply+barrel&qid=1664475481&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-3)
### There was no symbol for this so I found one in the existing library
### Need to organize better, separate and label parts, haven't added surge protection, need to ask if I need them for all microcontrollers
