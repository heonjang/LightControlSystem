In this note, I am going to talk about Frontend



For this project's frontend, we will use React.

The reason why we decided to use React is because

## 1. It is the most popular frontend framework
Because of its popularity, it has very rich developer communities. Therefore, it is much easier to build a good quality app

## 2. It is a mobile-friendly framework.
Since users will prefer using their phone, it is cruicial to be mobile-friendly.
