This week was mostly spent on finalizing the first round PCB schematics and layouts for our orders.
During the process of finalizing the layout, we realized that we were unable to place both ESP32 microcontrollers into the required dimension size, so we decided to remove one.
The motor subsystem will have to be separate from the PCB.
